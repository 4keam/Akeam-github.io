<h1>Who Am I</h1>


<b><h2>50 word description</h2></b>

<p1>
 Hi, my name is Akeam, im 15 years old and living in Edmonton. Im
 in grade 10 right now taking online learning. I'm 6ft 1 and play
 a lot of video games, watch anime, and basketball, or study.
 My family is all from India so I have Indian background and I
 love to learn more about my Indian culture in my spare time.
</p1>



<b><h3>50 word career plan.</h3></b>

<p2>
  In the future for my career plan, I look forward to going to
 university and getting a degree in being a software engineer or
 becoming a game developer
 I would have to do a lot of studying if I want to achieve this
 goal but I'm sure that I can achieve this with hard work and
 studying.
